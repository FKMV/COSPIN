\chapter{Lateral pile capacity (Full plastification)}\label{sec_7}

The lateral pile capacity is checked in accordance to both BSH, cf. Figure ~\ref{BSH}, and in accordance to DNVGL, cf. Figure ~\ref{DNV}. For the BSH check a resistance factor of 1.4 is applied to the resistance side of the soil springs, while for the DNVGL check the soil strength parameters are reduced by a material factor of 1.25. For both checks the utilization is below unity showing that the foundation has sufficient capacity against lateral loading.
