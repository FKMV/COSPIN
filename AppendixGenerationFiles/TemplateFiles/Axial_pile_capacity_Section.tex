\chapter{Axial and torsional pile capacity}\label{sec_8}

The axial pile capacity (the effect of torsional loading is accounted for in the figure) as function of embedded pile length is seen in Figure ~\ref{axial_capacity}. The axial utilization is found to be below 0.8, then axial loading is not considered to affect the lateral pile behaviour.
