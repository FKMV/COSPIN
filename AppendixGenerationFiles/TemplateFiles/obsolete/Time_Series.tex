\chapter{Time series of forces and acceleration for structural analyses}\label{sec_1}

Time series of forces and accelerations in the pile after a hammer blow is presented in 
 ~\ref{Time_Acc} and ~\ref{Time_Force} The time series are extracted at
different distance from the pile head representing LAP flange,replenishment hole and cable entry hole 
The Time series are presented for 3 different pile penetration depth.
